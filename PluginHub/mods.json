In reality, the cone of light haze is an effect only seen in dense atmospheres, and its appearance is also a sign of why the light is limited in range. Most of the environments a space engineer will find themselves in won't do either. In space, or on the Moon, Mars, or Europa, there is little or no atmosphere to scatter or limit light. So, on half of the planets/moons, and all of space in this game there is no reason to simulate that which would not exist.\nThe lines in the light cast have been removed, because experiments with light show that they would not be visible beyond a few feet in front of the spotlight. In order for a shadow to be cast by objects in front of the light, much more of the light must be obscured. The glass guard that is supposed to create the lines doesn't block the central point of the light source in any significant way, and is therefore invisible at a distance from the spotlight itself.\n  ",

While still providing all HUD voice notifications (and with FAR more variants) this mod is more about reminding you that you should already be paying attention ;)\n\nI'd intended this for April Fools, but hey... I'm sure in some multiverse someplace it's still on time.\n\nThe video is a demo of a few lines only, there are MANY more.\n\nReplaces the following Suit and Game Audio notifications:\n\n- All Suit and Ship Power Notifications\n- Hydrogen Notifications\n- Health Notifications\n- Handbrake and Antenna Notifications\n- Inventory Notifications\n- More planned...\n\nThere are MANY variations (91 currently) ;)\n\nThis mod was made live on Twitch with the help of the wonderful SE community, you can join us here: https://www.twitch.tv/w4stedspace",
