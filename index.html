<h1>Plugin Loader for Space Engineers</h1>
<p>
	The Plugin Loader is an easy way to install and load plugins and mods on the Space Engineers client. The Plugin Loader and plugins themselves still carry risk. However, plugins have value because they can edit game functionality in ways mods simply cannot. This means plugins offer gameplay possibilities that are otherwise impossible.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is free.</li>
	<li>It is open source under the MIT license.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Security is an important factor in Plugin Loader, so the team behind the Plugin Loader reviews items in the plugin list, manually, before they are made available. Plugins that are updated must be checked again before the updated version is released. All plugins on the list must also be open source so anyone can see the code that is running on their client.
