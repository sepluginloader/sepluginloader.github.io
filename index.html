<h1>Plugin Loader for Space Engineers</h1>
<p>
	Plugin Loader is an easy way to install and load plugins on the Space Engineers client. Plugins are essentially unrestricted mods, so they carry risk. However, this also means that plugins can provide new and interesting gameplay that would otherwise be impossible via mods.
</p>
<p>
	Security is an important factor in Plugin Loader, so the team behind the Plugin Loader reviews items in the plugin list, manually, before they are made available. Plugins that are updated must be checked again before the updated version is released. All plugins on the list must also be open source so anyone can see the code that is running on their client.
