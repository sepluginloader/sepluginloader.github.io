<p>
	To install Plugin Loader, a custom game launcher must be installed. The game launcher will automatically download and start Space Engineers with Plugin Loader.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Download the SpaceEngineersLauncher.exe file from the link above</li>
	<li>Make sure the exe file is not blocked before continuing by opening the file properties of the extracted file and checking the Unblock box (if it exists)</li>
	<li>The exe file can now be placed in the game Bin64 folder
		<ul>
			<li>You can find the Bin64 folder by right clicking on Space Engineers in Steam and selecting Properties. Then under the Local Files tab, select Browse and navigate to the Bin64 folder</li>
		</ul>

<p>To use the launcher on linux, a script may be required. See <a href="https://gist.github.com/opekope2/e02db7e526dadff0813a6ea2aebf820b">opekope2's solution</a></p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p><strong>I have graphics issues after installing Plugin Loader</strong></p>
<p>Make sure your display is set to use the correct GPU in the game display options. Also make sure SpaceEngineersLauncher.exe is set to high performance mode in your GPU's control panel.</p>
