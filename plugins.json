It will hopefully be fixed in a future version of the Wooting SDK.\n\nThere is also an issue with wheels and analog controls.

So, on half of the planets/moons, and all of space in this game there is no reason to simulate that which would not exist.\nThe lines in the light cast have been removed, because experiments with light show that they would not be visible beyond a few feet in front of the spotlight. In order for a shadow to be cast by objects in front of the light, much more of the light must be obscured. The glass guard that is supposed to create the lines doesn't block the central point of the light source in any significant way, and is therefore invisible at a distance from the spotlight itself.\n  ",

      "description": "\nBased on GPSHelper by CrazyDave137, seemingly abandoned and non-functional. I picked it up, cleaned it a bit, and fixed issues with string filtering. Commands are the same, I just fixed some internals and minor performance issuese that nobody would have noticed anyway.\n\nCode available on GitHub[github.com].\n\nUsage\n\n[string] denotes an optional parameter. You may provide it, or leave it blank.\n\nWhen adding a GPS, it will be used as the base name. Omitting will use the Player name instead.\n\nWhen filtering, providing an argument will try to do a substring match ('contains') on the GPS name, description, and hexadecimal string representation of the colour.\n\n/gpsx [string] creates a GPS point at current location, noting the local planet in the description. An auto-incrementing hexadecimal auto-ID string is appended to uniquely identify each GPS.\n/gpsx_reset resets the auto-incrementing auto-ID. Does not modify existing GPS.\n/gps_export [string] export all matching GPS to clipboard. No argument exports all GPS.\n/gps_toggle [string] toggle visibility of all matching GPS. No argument toggles all GPS.\n/gps_off [string] turn visibility of matching GPS off. No argument toggles all GPS.\n/gps_on [string] turn visibility of matching GPS on. No argument toggles all GPS.\n/gps_remove [string] remove all matching GPS. No argument removes all GPS. WARNING: Can not be undone!\n\nProps\n\nCrazyDave137 for authoring the original mod\nDigi for putting up with my endless flood of questions and being an all round nice chap\n  ",
